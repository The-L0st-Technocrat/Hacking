[About]

Bluediving is the next generation Bluetooth penetration suite.
It implements several exploits like BlueBug, BlueSnarf, BlueSnarf++ or BlueSmack,
tools like carwhisperer, redfang and bss and also offers features like a
RFCOMM scanner and a L2CAP packetgenerator.

Currently this code only runs on Linux 2.4 / 2.6 systems.
Now there is also a FreeBSD port, which should be considered to be in
Alpha state. Not all functionality has been ported and it's not massively
tested, but it's working basically.
You should have at least FreeBSD 5, but I am developing on a FreeBSD 6 
machine and I cannot asure that all of the code is also running on version 5.


[Requirements]

Linux 2.4 / 2.6
BlueZ
sox
obexftp
libreadline
expat / XML::Simple


[Installation]

Ok. Here we go... 

[1] Install bluez libs and utils, libreadline, sox, obexftp.
[2] Compile the shipped tools (cd tools; ./make-tools.sh)
[3] Install the Perl module XML::Simple (perl -MCPAN -e 'install XML::Simple')
[4] Have a look at the configuration file bluedivingNG.conf
