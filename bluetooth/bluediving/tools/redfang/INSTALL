1) change to bluez-utils-2.2 source directory

cd /usr/src/redhat/SOURCES/bluez-utils-2.2/

2) extract redfang tar to that directory

tar -xvf /tmp/redfang.tar ./

3) change to directory

cd redrang

4) run 'make'

make

5) run redfang

./redfang hunt 100000

note: 100000 is the timeout I have found anywhere between 25000 and 100000 
yield results. However 100000 will give reliable results (although slow)
