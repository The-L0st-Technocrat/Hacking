redfang - the bluetooth hunter

.intro
fang is a small proof-of-concept application to find non discoveredable
bluetooth devices. This is done by brute forcing the last six (6) bytes of 
the bluetooth address of the device and doing a read_remote_name().

currently to reduce the address space this will only scan the TDK 
manufacturer assigned space although this is very easy to change.

also due to the design of the bluez implementation of the bluetooth stack
under linux and the design of this application it is very easy to modify
the application to use multiple bluetooth devices (i.e. 4 threads 
simultaniously scanning).

.tested
redhat 9
