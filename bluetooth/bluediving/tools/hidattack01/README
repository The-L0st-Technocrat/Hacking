Basic example on how to attack HID servers (host part of the Human Interface
Device architecture). This basic example is against HID-keyboards, the
sample file injects the scan codes for the four letters "0wnD" into the victims
HID-server.

ha.inp are the key press events for "0wnD" it's the same format as 
/dev/input/eventX

client mode:
	./hidattack -e ha.inp -c BD_ADDR

server mode:
	./hidattack -e ha.inp -s


generate .inp file with dump_event
