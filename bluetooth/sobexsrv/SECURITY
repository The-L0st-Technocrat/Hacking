some remarks about security

-sobexsrv will refuse to run as root
-for chroot you need to suid-root sobexsrv, it will drop to the calling user
 after doing chroot
-directory traversal is possible when not running chroot
-great care has to be taken when writing handler scripts, since all security
 checks have to be performed by the script!


how to get a secure setup?

1) personal file access

   only allow connections from authenticated devices (using authentication and
   encryption), initial directory is your home directory
 
   sobexsrv -s 2 -Ir $HOME

2) public file distribution

   sobexsrv -IRr $HOME/obexpublic
