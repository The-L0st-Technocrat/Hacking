bt_audit v0.1.1 (c) 2003-2006 by Collin R. Mulliner <collin@betaversion.net>


bt_audit is a suit of programs and scripts to do Bluetooth(tm) device auditing.

The suit currently consists of two port scanners, psm_scan for the L2CAP layer
and rfcomm_scan for the RFCOMM layer.

psm_scan:
	find open L2CAP PSMs by scanning a certain range
	
rfcomm_scan:
	find open RFCOMM channels by scanning a certain range

btdsd_smaple.sh:
	scan script for device database

These tools were written as part of the "bluetooth device security database"
project. The main intention behind writing these was to discover some 
manufacturer backdoors or special features.

If you find any open PSMs or RFCOMM channel that don't relate to a service
entry in the SDP database, please report the device (manufacturer, version, ..)
