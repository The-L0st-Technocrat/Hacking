[intro]
Ok, this is the replay template and associated files.

[caution]
Do not delete file replay_l2cap_packet.c!

[files]
clean.sh - will clean out all the old crap
makereplay.sh - will compile your chosen test
replay_l2cap_packet.c - template used by BSS

[usage]
To use this identify the test case you want to compile and then do
	./makereplay <filename> 

NOTE: do not include the extension (i.e. .c), an example would be:
	./makereplay replay_l2cap_packet_11022005100456.0

Then simply run the test case i.e.:
	./replay <bdaddr>
