<h1>About Bluelog Live</h1>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Bluelog is a Bluetooth site survey tool, designed to
tell you how many discoverable devices there are in an area as quickly as possible.
As the name implies, its primary function is to log discovered devices to file
rather than to be used interactively. Bluelog could run on a system unattended for
long periods of time to collect data.
<p>
"Bluelog Live" is an advanced mode in which Bluelog generates a web page of it's
results which you can host with the HTTP daemon of your choice (Apache, lighttpd,
etc). The idea is that showing results on an easy to read web page helps the less
technically inclined understand the implications of discoverable Bluetooth devices
out in the wild. Showing somebody a parse log file might not get their attention,
but a real-time web page showing the same information is likely to generate a better
response.
