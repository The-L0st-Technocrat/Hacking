Full documentation has moved to sqlninja-howto.html, that you should have 
received together with this file. Hopefully, the new HTML version will be much 
easier to navigate and "digest".

Please read throught it before asking questions, as it explains everything 
that you need to know in order to have lots of fun with sqlninja.

Enjoy ! :)
