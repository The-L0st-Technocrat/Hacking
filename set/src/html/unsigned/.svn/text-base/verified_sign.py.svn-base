 This menu will allow you to import or create a valid code signing certificate for the Java Applet attack. 

 You will need to purchase a code signing certificate through GoDaddy, Thawte, Verisign, etc. in order to 
 make this work. This menu will automate the portions for you to either create the request to submit to the
 certificate authority or allow you to import a code signing certificate that you may already have.

 Note that purchasing a code signing certificate is somewhat difficult. It requires you to have a business name and 
 prove the legitimacy of that certificate. That means you have to register a business with the state and everything else.

 Good news is, the process to do that is extremely simple. All in all, it should cost roughly around $300-350 to setup your
 business, buy a code signing certificate, and publish an applet to be whatever you want.
