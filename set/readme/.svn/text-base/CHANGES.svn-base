 * Completely rehauled src/html/web_server.py to where it is no longer needed using pexpect. The goal is to move all depends to not require pexepct as it is not supported in Windows. All code now resides in src/html/spawn.py and is multi threading and background threaded
 * spawn.py uses multi-threaded webserver and rehauled to be windows compliant. pexpect is no longer used for windows systems as it is not supported, had to move to os.system for now, importing the module with thread locks caused lockup issues
 * rehauled listener.py to be compatible with windows 
 * fixed a bug that would cause pexpect to not be found if selecting SET interactive shell (no longer needed)
 * rehauled src/webattack/web_clone/cloner.py to be windows compliant and now supports java applet attack rewrite for wgeting websites
 * changed set executable to cleanup program_junk but skip .svn which would cause conflicts, this works on both windows and nix based systems

 * rehauled src/webattack/harvester/scraper.py to be windows compliant
 * rehauled src/webattack/harvester/harvester.py to be windows compliant
 * added the ability to keep execution flow of the backdoored executable (thanks pure_hate), this is now configurable through the config/set_config but disabled by default

 * removed the ability to be able to use spear phishing or wireless attack vectors on Windows for now 
 * converted src/webattack/web_clone/cloner.py to be the standard import for setcore, it was from src.core import setcore as core, changed to from src.core.setcore import *
 * bug fix when launching java applet attack and metasploit in 3.0 would cause the listener to not spawn properly
 * bug fix when selecting the SET interactive shell it would not copy the proper executable to pack/obfuscate 
 * bug fix that would cause the last exploit in spear phishing to not show a number
 * changed some output on wget to use -O instead of standard moves to filenames, much cleaner

 * added verbose messaging to attack vectors that are not yet supported for SET
 * rehauled multiattack to support windows-based attacks - it also now prompts if invalid payloads are selected
 * fixed a bug that when selecting menu 99 within multiattack, would say invalid selection. it now properly exits
 * increased the response time for using the SET interactive shell, it now loads much quicker
 * added a new config option to either use a staged downloader or download the SET interactive shell directory, this new feature is best for A/V detection but might be a little slower on what the user experiences. All of my testing shows that it doesn't however I'm also not testing over the Internet. The main problem is the staged downloader does a download/exec which would get flagged by AV. The SET interactive shell on the other hand is a wrapped python interpreter so its much harder to detect and flag with signatures. This new config option can be turned on to support staged configs if you aren't worried about A/V.
 * added new options within payloadprep.py (SET Interactive Shell prep) to detect the new config change options and flag the SE Interactive Shell as the main staged downloader
 * rewrote the Java Applet attack including the jar file to incorporate the straight staged downloader
 * added a new attack vector that I've been promising for several months called the QRCode Generator Attack Vector.. Create a QRCode with a URL then create a SET attack vector to assist with the attack
 * added new set menus to setcore so when you launch set theres some new ascii art... yea i got a little bored
 * fixed a bug that would cause the new stager option to not work within the Fast-Track MSSQL bruter menu
 * added a check to see if metasploit path was found, if not it will limit payloads only to SE Toolkit ones
 * added better handling around metasploit path detection and trigger error message when msf path is not set
 * added checking in set.py to detect attack vectors that require metasploit 
 * added a new cleanup routine that circles through directories cleaning up remenants of things saved out during normal operation
 * rewrote portions of teensy payloads to support windows
 * fixed a bug that would cause the menu to not load properly randomly (randrang was from 1 to 8 versus 2 to 8)
 * added permission change to executable on ratteserver so that it will always function normally if execute flag is removed
 * fixed a path issue with RATTEServer that would cause it to not properly load and flag an issue
 * converted RATTEServer to os.system versus pexpect child.spawn - easily more portable and less reliability on third party module
 * added RATTEServer for Windows (Cygwin mod) to support Windows operating system
 * added RATTEServer to payload selection list to now be supported via windows operating systems
 * added RATTEServer to payloadprep and spawn.py to deploy RATTEServer based on operating system i.e. windows/posix
 * added the ability to import custom binaries into windows versus linux only mode
 * fixed a bug in RATTEServer that would flag an error when spawning RATTE on Windows
 * added a chmod +x routine per each run of set instance if posix is detected.. will make it easier if certain permissions aren't set properly
 * added the ability to natively copy ratteserver.binary and cygwin to program_junk to be run
 * added payloadprep detailed error logging to the default log file being generated by SET

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  * fixed a bug that would not load the menus properly when loading SET (bad return placement)
  * fixed an annoying bug that has been around for a number of versions, finally tracked down..some occasions where it would show "Moving payload to website", you couldn't control-c out to exit and would have to close the console window. This has been resolved.
  * rewrote shellcodeexec again to evade AV

  * bug fix in mssql.py where it would throw an error about not finding the proper payload in the fasttrack mssql bruter

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
version 2.2.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  * Added significant stability to the java applet which caused a repeating loop of the java applet

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
version 2.2.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  * Added stability to the powershell attack through the java applet
  * If powershell injection is enabled and SETSHELL/RATTE is chosen, it will disable it automatically as the two are not compatible
  * Added a new config option to use verbose on the powershell injection, it will show you the encoded command that will be used on the victim machine
  * Got a patch from Dale Lakes on check_mssql, does smart detection on yum/apt for automatic installation

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
version 2.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  * Added better handling when generating your own legitimate certifcate and ensure proper import into SET
  * Adjusted java repeater time to have a little more delay, seems to be more reliable and stable if that occurs. 
  * Removed the check from the main launch of SET for pymssql and only added it when the fast-track menu was specified
  * Removed the derbycon posting since it already happened. When we get closer I'll re-add it back in with detailed information

  * Added new config check inside core.py, will return value of config, easier..will gradually replace all config checks with this
  * Fixed an issue that would cause AUTO_REDIRECT=OFF to still continue to redirect. This was caused from a rewrite of teh applet and the same parameters not being filtered properly
  * Added more customizing Options to RATTE. Now you can specifiy custom filename ratte uses for evading local firewalls. So you can deploy RATTE as readme.pdf.exe and it will run as iexplore.exe to bypass local firewalls. You can although specify if RATTE should be persistent or not. For testing network firewalls you won't need a persistent one. Doing a penetration test you may choose a persistent configuration.
  * Fixed a bug in RATTE which could break connection to Server. RATTE now runs much more stable and can bypass high end network firewalls much more reliable.
  * Added a new config option called POWERSHELL_INJECTION, this uses the technique discovered by Matthew Graeber which injects shellcode directly into memory through powershell
  * Added a new teensy powershell attack leveraging Matthew Graeber attack vector.
  * Rehauled the Java Applet attack to incorporate the powershell injectiont technique, its still experimental, so will remain OFF in the config by default. The applet will not detect if Powershell is installed, and if so, use the shellcode deployment method to gain memory execution without touching disk through PowerShell.
  * Fixed a bug that would cause mssql bruter to error if powershell injection was enabled or other attack vectors

   * Removed the modified calc.exe and replaced with a modified version of putty.exe to get better AV detection
   * Redid the dll hijacking attack to include rar and zip files, rar is better to use winzip compatible and will execute
   * Added an additional dll hijacking dll that will be used for the main attack, uses a purely C++ native method for downloading and executing payloads
   * Fixed the defaulting application for the Client-Side attack vector, it was defaulting to PDF when it should be an IE exploit
   * Fixed a bug where hitting enter at the web attack vector would cause an integer base 10 error message
   * Added the Adobe Shockwave browser exploit that I wrote for the Metasploit Framework. 
   * Moved all of the SET menu mode source to main/set.py, the main set loader is just a small import now. More clean.
   * Changed some spacing issues in the client-side attack vectors
   * In spear-phishing, cleaned up excess messages being presented back to the user when PDF was created or files were moved
   * Fixed a bug in the web cloner where certain ASPX sites wouldn't clone and register properly, thanks for the patch Craig! Added you to credits.
   * Added the SMS attack vector which can spoof SMS messages to a victim, it will be useful in nature if you want them to click a link or go somewhere you have a malicious site. Thanks to the TB-Security.com for the addition.
   * Added the Metasploit Sun Java Runtime New Plugin docbase Buffer Overflow universal client side attack
   * Added the parameter for the java applet called separate_jvm, this will spawn a new jvm instance so cache does not need to be cleaned
   * Fixed a bug where the SET Python web server would not properly shut down in certain circumstances
   * Added a repeatitive refresh flash for the java applet, so if a user hits cancel, it will prompt over and over until run is hit. Better way of getting the user to hit run.
   * Added the configuration option to turn off the java repeater, so if your using something like multi-attack you can specify so it doesn't keep nagging the user if you want multiple attack vectors
   * Fixed a bug where spear phishing attack would not spawn meterpreter listener when yes was specified, this was caused by the new dll hijacking addition.
   * Added better connection handling through the spear-phishing and gmail integration, it wasn't properly closing the connection per request
   * Fixed bug where using infectious media and file format would prompt you to use the spear-phishing mailer option afterwards, it no longer prompts for that during infectious media creation
   * Removed the option to include how many times to include, automatically defaults to 4, option is configurable in set_config now
   * Added the Metasploit Adobe FlashPlayer "Button" Remote Code Execution exploit to the spear-phishing/file format attack vectors

   * Removed the return to continue prompt in the Teensy HID USB attack vector, it wasn't needed and added additional steos
   * Added the new SET web interface, it primarily utilizes the new set-automate functionality based on responses for a payload, will improve as time goes on
   * Added the reverse DNS meterpreter payload to both client-side attacks as well as payload generators for things like Java Applet, Teensy, attacks, etc.
   * Fixed an issue where the Adobe 'Button' exploit was not properly loading and exporting the PDF through Metasploit
   * Added the Internet Explorer CSS Tags Memory Corruption exploit to the Metasploit Client-Side attack vector through web attack.
   * Fixed a large bug within mass mailer, if you were using Google Mail with multiple targets, there was a mis-matched counter that would only send one email, not to the rest of the list. It now functions correctly
   * Fixed a bug where if you turned sendmail to off and you used open mail relays, the email wouldn't be delivered properly. It now sends as expected
   * Added javascript replacement of the ipaddress under name in Java Applet, this is configurable under set_config, it defaults now to Secure Java Applet instead of your IP Address (more believable)
   * Added the ability to change the bind interface for the command center. By default its on localhost only, but you can configure to listen on all interfaces and hit the web interface remotely.
   * Updated the SET User Manual to reflect the changes of version 1.0, it incorporates the web interface, set-automate, SMS spoofing, new configuration options, and much more.
   * Fixed a bug where you would leave SET or still be in and a stale HTTP web server process would still be there. SET now checks to see if the process is stale and terminates it.
   * Added the ability to toggle different shell terminal windows within the command-center. For example you can select XTERM, KONSOLE, and GNOME through the set_config. XTERM will be the default.
   * Fixed where the repeater and java applet wouldn't properly work if you used your own template or ones built into SET
   * Added a new set_config option for the timing around java-repeater. You can set the seconds for it to repop if you want to tune. Default is 200 (2 seconds)
   * Added a default option in Java Applet attack, if you hit return for targetting Linux/OSX it will default to port 8080 and port 8081 for the listeners 
   * Fixed a small menu bug within client-side attack, the menus wouldn't line up properly
   * Added a patch from Thomas Roth to fix a bug in the java_applet pde file for the Teensy attack vector
   * Fixed a bug where site would not clone properly or inject iframes in certain websites, it was due to lack of proper regular expression filters, this has been corrected
   * Added better detection on site cloner to handler <head> tags with java applet that aren't standard, for example <head somethingelsehere>
   * Fixed a pervasive bug that has been around since 0.3 which when running SET and the python web-server, if you exited you would have to wait a period of time to relaunch because of the TIME_WAIT flag on the socket. After some recoding of the web-server, the socket can be rebound with the TIME_WAIT flag still in play and still function normally
   * Added better detection on site cloner to handler <head> tags with metasploit browser attack. There were times where the site would clone but not properly inject iframes into the head tags. This has been resolved in both single metasploit client-attack and multiattack
   * Changed iframes to <frame> to fix bugs within MSF-based payloads. They die if iframes are utilized for some reason. Thanks Matt!
   * Added a new configuration flag that turns autoscript migrate -f on metasploit based payloads, new flag is AUTO_MIGRATE=OFF/ON
   * Added better error handling in the main set loader, was throwing proc errors every so often
   * Added a new flag within the set_config called digital_signature_steal which incorporates Didier Stevens digital signature stealing tool called disitool
   * Added an addition to the docbase exploit, if the exploit is selected, framesets are used for the attack vector because with iframes it completely bombed, this was a funky workaround
   * Added a new configuration flag to turn persistence on with Metasploit's Meterpreter if you want it
   * Removed persistence configuration option, it will be shortly replaced by a much more flexible configuration
   * Added a new config option that allows you to specify a multiscript meterpreter command. In cases where you use SET and maybe your sleeping or you aren't there, you can piggy back script execution on a meterpreter session connection. For example you could run persistence, or run other scripts that help aid your effort on the penetration test.
   * Fixed a bug where import your own payload would not properly work within the java applet
   * Fixed a bug where meterpreter multi scripts was not properly defined within metasploit client-side attacks and would throw an exception
   * Fixed an import error issue with base64 when sending base64 encoded emails through multiple email medians
   * Added the ability to customize what port the metasploit browser attack runs on, by default its on 8080 however this is now customizable through the set_config
   * Fixed a base 10 error message within SET in the Web attack menu, if you did not input an integer it would error out giving a base 10 error message, it now returns to the prior menu as expected
   * Added better executable obfuscation on the filename when the Java Applet triggers, it use to be static to java.exe, now its a randomized executable name.
   * Changed the client side attack to default to the docbase buffer overflow instead of the xss vulnerability, more universal in nature
   * Added some more comments in the set_config file for confusion around the self-signed java applet functionality
   * Fixed a bug where the Java Repeater on some systems would not properly forward off to the legitimate cloned website when run was hit, seemed to affect Windows XP in certain scenarios, this has since been corrected and properly addresses the legitimate site after run has been executed
   * When using option 4, it would ask for two IP addresses with AUTO_DETECT=OFF, this has been changed to only flag to one question since the listener binds to 0.0.0.0 (all interfaces)
   * Turned digitial signature stealing ON by default, it will just default back to normal if it doesn't detect the pefile import
   * Changed wording to reflect reverse dns as a hostname not tunneling over DNS, was wrong description

   * Fixed bug where GMAIL sometimes requires TLS, it will detect if TLS is needed and utilize this
   * Rewrote the majority of the web server handler, now utilizes forked simplehttpserver in python and  can dynamically import anything now, much easier method for handling multiple files now.
   * Added two payload delivery options for OSX and Linux in the Java Applet attack, you can now select if you want to create a Lin/OSX payload and have them deployed via the Java Applet. Currently only supports reverse_tcp shells.
   * Bug fixed template creation where when it dynamically imported newlines would be messed up.
   * Based on Hak5 and Mubix, I have changed it so that the website and listener is up and running before the emails are sent out. I simply create a child thread that interacts in the background and if the set_config option for WEBMAIL_ATTACK=ON, it will call that variable and allow you to send emails out while the listener and website runs in the background. As soon as your finished with the email, it will then interact with the child process and allow you to interact.
   * Added Metasploit browser exploits into the website attack vector, this will allow you to utilize the web cloning or pre-defined template in SET and select either a Java Applet method, or Metasploit Browser exploits.
