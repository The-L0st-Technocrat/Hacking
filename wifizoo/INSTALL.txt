How to use it?
==============

python wifizoo.py

and that's it! the help will be displayed!.

Remember, you must have scapy.py installed!.

Don't use the scapy.py version available from your Linux distribution (such as the 'apt-get version' available from debian or ubuntu), go to scapy's website and download the latest version!. Otherwise WifiZoo will not function correctly!.

Once you have the latest scapy.py, copy the file to the same directory where wifizoo.py is located, and that's it!.
