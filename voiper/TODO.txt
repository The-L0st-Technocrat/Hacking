(sulley) - Issues relating to the Sulley fuzzing framework

Patches and suggestions relating to any of these (or other features) 
are more than welcome

Check out http://voiper.wiki.sourceforge.net for info on the development of these
features

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Functionality
- Allow a range of test cases to be specified
- Use call backs to insert valid IPs into fields where they are currently static e.g. TO and FROM
- All a timeout to be specified between test cases
+ Add a function to allow VoIPER to register with a registrar
- Add TCP support (waiting to see some devices that use this first)
+ Add H.323 support
+ Add IAX support
+ Add extra fuzz cases for SIP and SDP (inc. REGISTER, OPTIONS, NOTIFY, SUBSCRIBE, BYE)


- Give cancel threads notification when done fuzzing
- Check RFC 3261 to ensure all headers are being covered
	* Done for INVITE_COMMON but need to improve Content-Type header and others where there is the possibility of iterating over a 	group of predefined strings e.g CSeq method part
- Fix tabbing on GUI
- Normalise the wait for register stuff into one class seperate from the interfaces
- Added 'estimated time remaining' to GUI
+ Hybrid inband and process monitoring crash detection
+ Rewrite the cancellation/protocol level crash detection modules and integrate them into a single 'listener' 
- Allow the crash threshold and the timeout to allow a client to settle in after a restart to be configurable by the user

Optimisation
- Add support for parallel testing of multiple targets (sulley)
- Add hash map to avoid sending duplicate test cases (sulley)
- Fix issue of fuzzer hanging when done with fuzz cases (sulley)

Quality
- Write documentation on how to add new fuzzers
- Add 'help' info to the fuzzer classes
- Fix the generation of epydocs
- Integrate the usage information from README.txt into USAGE.txt
