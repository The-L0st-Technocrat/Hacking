- Level 1 and 2 crash detection are unreliable. This is fixed in the development branch
  and will be merged soon. Use level 3 when possible.
- On Windows sometimes we get an exception 'No buffer space available' when trying
  to send data. This seems to be an issue with Winsock/Windows so short of catching the 
  exception and trying again I'm not sure if there's much we can do. For now just
  if you must run the fuzzer on Windows and this occurs just kill the process and 
  restart
- When finished fuzzing or if an exception occurs the program hangs and can't be 
  killed via a Ctrl-C or whatever. This is because of some problem with Sulley and 
  will hopefully be resolved in their next release. Use Ctrl-Z the kill -9 PID.
- The GUI doesn't display exceptions that occur during execution
- There are some other annoyances with the GUI

Changes required for OS X:
- OS X appears to only support sending of up to 9216 bytes of data via UDP. As a result
some limits must be changed in misc/sip_utilities.py and sulley/sulley/sessions.py. Search
for the number 65507 and replace and instances of it with 9216
- OS X 10.5 (and some versions of Ubuntu apparently) have an issue with certain paramaters
to socket.setsockopt() (namely the NOLINGER options used by Sulley). Removing the setsockopt() 
call from the __connect method of sulley/sulley/pedrpc.py seems to resolve this without any
particularly harmful consequences
